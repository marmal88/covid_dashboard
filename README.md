### 1.1 Setting up python version and creating virtual environment
**Create Python Environment**
To create the correct python version use the command, If done correctly the `.python-version` file containing the python version should be created:

```bash
# Check if you have the python version installed on your computer
pyenv versions | grep 3.11.4

# If version does not exists, then search for version using command:
pyenv install -l
# and install using command:
pyenv install 3.11.4

# Once installed check which version is currently being activated using command:
pyenv versions
# To activate the version locally use command:
pyenv local 3.11.4

# Check again if right python version has been installed
python -V
```

```bash
# initialize poetry environment
